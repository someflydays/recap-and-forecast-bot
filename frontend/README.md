# Frontend

To test the frontend locally, you first need to run the backend server. Please see `recap-and-forecast-bot/backend/README.md` for instructions.

Once the backend server is running, open a separate terminal and run the following command from the `recap-and-forecast-bot/frontend/` directory:
```
npm run dev
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
